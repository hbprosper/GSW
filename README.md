# The Glashow-Salam-Weinberg Model
This tutorial, implemented as a Python notebook, provides a detailed step-by-step exposition of the detailed algebraic structure of the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg model of electroweak interations. The notebook has been tested with Python 3.7.4.

## Dependencies
The jupyter notebook uses the free, yet amazingly powerful, Python symbolic algebra module __sympy__.
